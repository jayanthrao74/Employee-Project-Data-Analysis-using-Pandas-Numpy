## 👤 About the Project

Organizations often deal with **fragmented datasets** across employees, projects, and seniority levels.  
This project brings them together into a **single, analysis-ready dataset** while applying real business logic such as:

- Missing value treatment
- Bonus allocation
- Promotions & demotions
- Employee filtering
- Aggregated cost analysis
